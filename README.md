# Nand2Tetris-Build-a-computer
My journey through building a 16 bit Hack computer following the guide and instructions on Nand2tetris.org

I am taking this class through Coursera.org

I am taking this class because I was interested in learning how a computer is built and to learn the fundementals. 
I plan on entering computer science and this is a very well thought out project. There is also a large active community with forums for questions.

Through this course I have learned the fundamentals of computers.

Starting with the fundamental Nand gate
I have built And, Or, Xor,.....up to 16 bit Mux16 gates
From these gates, I have built a ROM32k that includes the instruction programs, screen memory map, and keyboard register.
a RAM16k for the CPU to use for data storage.
A CPU out of an earlier ALU and registers.

I have gained an understanding of how Hardware Descriptive Language(HDL) works and how Machine Language works.

I am currently on project 6. I will update this as I progress!
